# I can't for the life of me figure out how to catch a keyboard interrupt
# in the PyObjCTools framework. As a workaround, when the Python event
# sniffer starts it writes a file called .python_pid with the pid of the
# current process. Instead of invoking the Python event sniffer directly,
# we launch it in the background here and loop infinitely. The shell script
# catches keyboard interrupts and kills the correct Python process.
